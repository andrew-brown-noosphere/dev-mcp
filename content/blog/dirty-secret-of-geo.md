# The Dirty Little Secret of GEO: It's All Built on SEO

*January 27, 2026*

There's a new category of startups selling "Generative Engine Optimization" and "AI Search Visibility." They promise to get your brand mentioned by ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews.

Here's what they don't tell you: **it's all SEO with a fresh coat of paint.**

## How Agents Actually Work

I ran a protocol experiment last week. I tried to get an AI agent to navigate directly to my site and complete a handshake. It couldn't.

Why? Because agents don't browse. They don't navigate. They don't explore.

**Agents are routed through search indexes.**

```
What you think happens:
Agent → Your Website

What actually happens:
Agent → Search Index → Allowed Fetch → Your Content
```

## The Implication Nobody Talks About

If agents access your content through search indexes, then "optimizing for AI" means... optimizing for search indexes.

Which is SEO.

The GEO vendors are selling you a dashboard that monitors whether AI mentions you. But the *mechanism* by which you get mentioned is the same mechanism that's always existed: **being indexed, being authoritative, being cited.**

## What GEO Companies Actually Measure

- Are you in the search index? (SEO)
- Do authoritative sites link to you? (SEO)
- Is your content structured and crawlable? (SEO)
- Do you rank for relevant queries? (SEO)

They just renamed the outputs. Instead of "rankings," it's "AI mentions." Instead of "SERP position," it's "citation frequency."

**Same inputs. Same mechanisms. New dashboard.**

## The Real Question They Can't Answer

Ask any GEO vendor this question:

> "How does an AI agent reach my content if I'm not in a search index?"

They can't answer it. Because there's no mechanism for direct agent navigation yet. The infrastructure doesn't exist.

## What Would Actually Be Different

Real agent optimization would require:

1. **Direct agent reachability** — agents navigating to you without search intermediaries
2. **Agent authentication** — verifying an agent's identity and permissions
3. **Capability negotiation** — telling agents what you can do, programmatically

None of this exists yet. We're still in the "search index as DNS" phase.

## The Honest Positioning

If a GEO company said: "We help you monitor how your SEO performance affects AI citations" — that would be honest.

But "Generative Engine Optimization" implies there's a *different* engine to optimize for. There isn't. It's the same engine. The output is just being rendered differently.

## What To Do Instead

1. **Keep doing SEO** — it's still the reachability layer
2. **Build structured content** — llms.txt, context files, markdown
3. **Watch for real agent infrastructure** — when agents can navigate directly, everything changes
4. **Don't pay for rebranded SEO dashboards**

*The companies selling GEO today are selling visibility into a system they don't control and can't change. The real opportunity is building the infrastructure that replaces search-mediated access entirely.*

**DevExp.ai** is building agent infrastructure, not AI monitoring dashboards.
