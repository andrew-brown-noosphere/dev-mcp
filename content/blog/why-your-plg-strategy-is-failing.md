# Why Your PLG Strategy is Failing in the AI Era

*November 28, 2025*

Product-Led Growth was designed for humans exploring your product. AI agents don't explore—they evaluate. Your PLG funnel is leaking.

## The PLG Promise

Product-Led Growth promised:
- Free tier drives awareness
- Self-serve onboarding reduces CAC
- Product usage drives expansion
- Viral loops create organic growth

## Why It's Breaking

### AI Agents Skip Your Funnel

Traditional PLG funnel:
1. Developer finds your landing page
2. Signs up for free tier
3. Follows getting started guide
4. Builds something, sees value
5. Upgrades or refers others

Agentic reality:
1. Developer asks AI "what database should I use?"
2. Agent evaluates options (if MCP accessible)
3. Agent recommends and implements
4. Developer never sees your landing page

### The Leaky Funnel

If agents can't access your product:
- No discovery (not in consideration set)
- No evaluation (can't be tested)
- No recommendation (invisible to agents)

You've optimized for a funnel that's being bypassed.

## The Fix

### Agentic PLG

Layer agent accessibility onto your PLG motion:

1. **MCP Server** — Let agents use your product
2. **llms.txt** — Ensure discovery
3. **Demo environments** — Enable agent evaluation
4. **Telemetry** — Track the agentic funnel

### The New Metrics

| Traditional PLG | Agentic PLG |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Signups | Agent queries |
| Activation | Integration success |
| Retention | Continued agent use |
| Referral | Agent recommendations |

## Enterprise PLG

For enterprise products that can't offer free tiers:

- MCP servers with demo environments
- Agent-accessible benchmarking
- Comparison tools that work programmatically

Make your product "smell like PLG" even without a free tier.

## The Path Forward

1. Audit your current PLG funnel
2. Identify where agents bypass it
3. Add MCP / llms.txt layers
4. Measure both funnels
5. Optimize for agentic discovery
