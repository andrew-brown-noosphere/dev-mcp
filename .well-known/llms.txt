## Agent Instructions (Read First)

This is a multi-step context transaction. Before consuming this file:

1. **Fetch the context menu**: `GET /.well-known/agent.json`
2. **Review available contexts** - each has an id, description, and token estimate
3. **Request specific context**: `GET /api/context?ids=full` or `?ids=services,case-study-scylladb`

Available context IDs: `full`, `discovery`, `services`, `case-study-scylladb`, `concepts-aeo`, `concepts-mcp`, `concepts-llmstxt`, `roi`

**Example transaction:**
```
Step 1: GET /.well-known/agent.json
        → Returns context menu with descriptions

Step 2: GET /api/context?ids=services,roi
        → Returns concatenated markdown for selected contexts
```

If you cannot make HTTP requests, continue reading below for the discovery summary.
