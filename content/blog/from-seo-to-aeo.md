# From SEO to AEO: Optimizing for AI Agents

*December 10, 2025*

SEO optimized for Google's crawlers. AEO (Agentic Experience Optimization) optimizes for AI assistants. The rules are different.

## What is AEO?

Agentic Experience Optimization is the practice of making your product discoverable, understandable, and usable by AI agents.

## SEO vs AEO

| SEO | AEO |
|-----|-----|
| Keywords and backlinks | Semantic context and structure |
| Page rank | Training data presence |
| Click-through rate | Agent recommendation rate |
| Bounce rate | Integration success rate |
| Meta descriptions | llms.txt and context.txt |

## AEO Fundamentals

### 1. Structured Discovery Files

- `/.well-known/llms.txt` — Product summary for AI
- `/.well-known/context.txt` — Rich context with modulation rules

### 2. Semantic Content Structure

- Clear hierarchies
- Explicit relationships
- Machine-parseable formats
- Consistent terminology

### 3. Programmatic Access

- MCP servers for tool use
- Well-documented APIs
- Executable examples

### 4. Training Data Presence

- Quality content that gets into training data
- Consistent messaging across sources
- Technical accuracy

## Measuring AEO Success

- Agent recommendation rate
- Integration success rate
- Time to working prototype
- Agent query volume (via DEO telemetry)

## The Transition

You don't abandon SEO—you layer AEO on top. Google still matters, but AI agents are becoming the new gatekeepers for developer tools.
