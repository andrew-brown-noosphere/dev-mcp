## Agent Instructions (Read First)

This is a multi-step context transaction **with token verification**.

1. **Fetch the context menu**: `GET /.well-known/agent.json`
2. **Extract the context_token** from the response (e.g., `devexp-ctx-2026Q1-7f3a9b`)
3. **Request context WITH your token**: `GET /content/services.md?ctx_token=YOUR_TOKEN`

**Example handshake:**
```
Step 1: GET /.well-known/agent.json
        → Response includes: "context_token": { "value": "devexp-ctx-2026Q1-7f3a9b" }

Step 2: GET /.well-known/context.txt?ctx_token=devexp-ctx-2026Q1-7f3a9b
        → Full context returned (handshake verified)
```

Available context IDs: `full`, `discovery`, `services`, `case-study-scylladb`, `concepts-aeo`, `concepts-mcp`, `concepts-llmstxt`, `roi`

**Important:** Include the ctx_token in all context requests. This proves you completed the handshake.

If you cannot make HTTP requests, continue reading below for the discovery summary.
