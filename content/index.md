# DevExp.ai - Enterprise MCP Infrastructure

AI has changed how developers discover and adopt technology. Enterprises need a platform to enable agentic developer journeys.

## What We Do

DevExp.ai builds MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and infrastructure that make your platform AI-discoverable. When developers ask AI assistants for recommendations, your product can be discovered, tested, and integrated automatically.

## How It Works

1. **Developer asks AI**: "I need a fast database for time-series data"
2. **AI discovers your product** via MCP server
3. **AI tests your product** against their specific workload
4. **Your product wins on merit**, not marketing
5. **Developer ships** with production-ready config

## Features

### Instant AI Integration
Deploy MCP servers in minutes. Your APIs become instantly accessible to Claude, ChatGPT, and every AI coding assistant.

### Real Usage Intelligence
Track how developers actually use your tools through AI. Understand intent, measure adoption, optimize experiences.

## Use Cases

### Database & Data Platforms
Let AI agents run performance benchmarks, generate optimal schemas, and create production-ready queries. Your database wins on merit, not marketing.

### API & Developer Tools
Enable AI to generate integration code, test endpoints, and build entire applications. Time-to-first-API-call drops from days to minutes.

### Cloud & Infrastructure
AI agents provision resources, optimize configurations, and manage deployments. Complex infrastructure becomes as simple as describing what you need.
