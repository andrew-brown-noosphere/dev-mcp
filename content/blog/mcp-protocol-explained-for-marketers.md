# MCP Protocol Explained for Marketers

*December 20, 2025*

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is how AI agents interact with external tools. Here's what marketing leaders need to know.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard that lets AI assistants like Claude connect to external tools and data sources. Think of it as "APIs for AI agents."

## Why Marketers Should Care

### The New Distribution Channel

When developers ask AI assistants for tool recommendations, the agent can:
1. Check if you have an MCP server
2. Actually test your product
3. Make recommendations based on real performance

**No MCP server = invisible to this channel.**

### The New Competitive Landscape

In traditional marketing:
- Best SEO wins discovery
- Best content wins consideration
- Best sales team wins deals

In agentic marketing:
- MCP accessibility wins discovery
- Product quality wins evaluation (agents test it)
- Integration ease wins adoption

## MCP for Non-Technical Leaders

### What an MCP Server Does

It lets AI agents:
- **Query** your product (get information)
- **Execute** actions (create, update, delete)
- **Test** capabilities (benchmarks, comparisons)

### What This Means for Marketing

| Traditional | With MCP |
|-------------|----------|
| Developers read your docs | Agents use your product |
| You control the narrative | Product speaks for itself |
| Sales demos show features | Agents run real evaluations |
| Marketing creates demand | Quality creates recommendations |

## The Investment

| Component | Cost | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| MCP Server | $25K | Make product AI-accessible |
| Telemetry | $2K/mo | Track agent engagement |
| Maintenance | Ongoing | Keep up with product changes |

## Key Questions for Your Team

1. Do we have an MCP server?
2. Can AI agents actually use our product?
3. How do we measure agent engagement?
4. What's our AEO (Agentic Experience Optimization) strategy?

## The Bottom Line

MCP is becoming table stakes for developer tools. If AI agents can't access your product, they can't recommend it. That's a distribution problem marketing needs to solve.
