# Calculating MCP ROI: A Framework for Developer Tools

*January 5, 2026*

Is building an MCP server worth the investment? Here's how to calculate the return.

## The Investment

| Component | One-Time | Ongoing |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| MCP Server Development | $25,000 | - |
| Maintenance | - | $2-5K/mo |
| Telemetry (VoyantIO) | - | $2K/mo |
| **Total Year 1** | $25,000 | $48-84K |

## The Returns

### Direct Revenue Impact

**Agent-Influenced Deals:**
- Deals where AI agents were part of evaluation
- Faster sales cycles (agents do initial qualification)
- Higher win rates (product tested, not demoed)

**Formula:**
```
Agent-Influenced Revenue =
  (Deals with agent involvement) ×
  (Average deal size) ×
  (Win rate improvement)
```

### Indirect Benefits

**Reduced Support Costs:**
- Agents handle common questions
- Better onboarding = fewer support tickets
- Self-serve evaluation reduces sales engineering load

**Competitive Positioning:**
- Being MCP-accessible when competitors aren't
- Early mover advantage in agentic distribution
- Signal of technical sophistication

## ROI Calculation

### Conservative Scenario

Assumptions:
- 10 additional deals/year from agent discovery
- $50K average deal size
- 20% win rate improvement on agent-influenced deals

```
Revenue Impact: 10 × $50K × 1.2 = $600K
Investment: $25K + $60K = $85K
ROI: ($600K - $85K) / $85K = 606%
```

### Realistic Scenario

Assumptions:
- 25 additional deals/year
- $50K average deal size
- 25% win rate improvement

```
Revenue Impact: 25 × $50K × 1.25 = $1.56M
Investment: $85K
ROI: 1,735%
```

## Comparison: MCP vs Traditional Marketing

| Channel | Cost | Leads | Cost/Lead |
|---------|------|-------|-----------|
| Conference booth | $50K | 200 | $250 |
| Content marketing | $100K/yr | 500 | $200 |
| DevRel hire | $200K/yr | 300 | $667 |
| **MCP Server** | $85K/yr | 500+ | $170 |

## When MCP ROI is Highest

- Technical products requiring evaluation
- Competitive markets with comparison shopping
- Complex products with long sales cycles
- Developer-focused tools

## When to Wait

- Very early stage (no product-market fit)
- Non-technical buyers
- Zero AI agent traffic in your category

## The Real Cost of Waiting

Every month without MCP accessibility:
- Competitors gain agent discovery share
- Agents learn to recommend alternatives
- Training data gap widens

The question isn't "can we afford MCP?" It's "can we afford to be invisible to AI agents?"
